HybridView
=========

HybridView is a demo project that embeds HTML inside a Xamarin application.
This allows you to,

* Seamlessly move from Cordova to Xamarin and back, as long as you are not using plugins
* Allow your single page HTML applications to be packaged easily as a mobile app
* Allow you to write native capabilities in C#, thereby keeping the advantages of cordova, and yet being able to write native like performance in a single language, C#

## A detailed explanation of this project can be found in my Pluralsight course, chapter 5, at https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/cordova-apps-angular-typescript-vscode/table-of-contents ##

To run, you will need, VS2015 with Xamarin tools, and access to a Mac for iOS dev.
You'll need to configure VS2015 to be able to talk to the Mac (Xamarin agent)

Alternatively you can just run this on a Mac using Visual Studio for Mac (not VSCode)

Or you can target Android.
